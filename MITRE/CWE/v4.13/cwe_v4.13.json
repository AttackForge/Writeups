The intention of this functionality is to bypass authentication and access control checks within the .NET application code. Authentication is done by the underlying web server (Microsoft Internet Information Service IIS), which passes the authenticated token, or unauthenticated anonymous token, to the .NET application. Using the token to impersonate the client, the application then relies on the settings within the NTFS directories and files to control access. Impersonation enables the application, on the server running the .NET application, to both execute code and access resources in the context of the authenticated and authorized user.",

Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Mitigation of resource exhaustion attacks requires that the target system either:<br/><br/>The first of these solutions is an issue in itself though, since it may allow attackers to prevent the use of the system by a particular valid user. If the attacker impersonates the valid user, they may be able to prevent the user from accessing the server in question.<br/><br/>The second solution can be difficult to effectively institute -- and even when properly done, it does not provide a full solution. It simply requires more resources on the part of the attacker.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Ensure that protocols have specific limits of scale placed on them.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Implementation<br/>Description: If the program must fail, ensure that it fails gracefully (fails closed). There may be a temptation to simply let the program fail poorly in cases such as low memory conditions, but an attacker may be able to assert control before the software has fully exited. Alternately, an uncontrolled failure could cause cascading problems with other downstream components; for example, the program could send a signal to a downstream process so the process immediately knows that a problem has occurred and has a better chance of recovery.<br/><br/>Ensure that all failures in resource allocation place the system into a safe posture.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Resource Limitation<br/>Description: Use resource-limiting settings provided by the operating system or environment. For example, when managing system resources in POSIX, setrlimit() can be used to set limits for certain types of resources, and getrlimit() can determine how many resources are available. However, these functions are not available on all operating systems.<br/><br/>When the current levels get close to the maximum that is defined for the application (see CWE-770), then limit the allocation of further resources to privileged users; alternately, begin releasing resources for less-privileged users. While this mitigation may protect the system from attack, it will not necessarily stop attackers from adversely impacting other users.<br/><br/>Ensure that the application performs the appropriate error checks and error handling in case resources become unavailable (CWE-703).<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis<br/>Description: Manual static analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, but it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. If denial-of-service is not considered a significant risk, or if there is strong emphasis on consequences such as code execution, then manual analysis may not focus on this weakness at all.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Fuzzing<br/>Description: While fuzzing is typically geared toward finding low-level implementation bugs, it can inadvertently find uncontrolled resource allocation problems. This can occur when the fuzzer generates a large number of test cases but does not restart the targeted product in between test cases. If an individual test case produces a crash, but it does not do so reliably, then an inability to limit resource allocation may be the cause.<br/><br/>When the allocation is directly affected by numeric inputs, then fuzzing may produce indications of this weakness.<br/>Effectiveness: Opportunistic<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Dynamic Analysis<br/>Description: Certain automated dynamic analysis techniques may be effective in producing side effects of uncontrolled resource allocation problems, especially with resources such as processes, memory, and connections. The technique may involve generating a large number of requests to the product within a short time frame. Manual analysis is likely required to interpret the results.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Specialized configuration or tuning may be required to train automated tools to recognize this weakness.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis typically has limited utility in recognizing unlimited allocation problems, except for the missing release of program-independent system resources such as files, sockets, and processes, or unchecked arguments to memory. For system resources, automated static analysis may be able to detect circumstances in which resources are not released after they have expired, or if too much of a resource is requested at once, as can occur with memory. Automated analysis of configuration files may be able to detect settings that do not specify a maximum value.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis tools will not be appropriate for detecting exhaustion of custom resources, such as an intended security policy in which a bulletin board user is only allowed to make a limited number of posts per day."

In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Build and Compilation, Operation<br/>Description: Most mitigating technologies at the compiler or OS level to date address only a subset of buffer overflow problems and rarely provide complete protection against even that subset.

Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.

Design the product so that this trust is managed in a centralized fashion, especially if there are complex or numerous communication channels, in order to reduce the risks that the implementer will mistakenly omit a check in a single code path.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Testing<br/>Description: Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Testing<br/>Description: Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules."

[REF-330]<br/><br/>Another example is the ESAPI Session Management control, which includes a component for CSRF. [REF-45]<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Ensure that the application is free of cross-site scripting issues (CWE-79), because most CSRF defenses can be bypassed using attacker-controlled script.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Generate a unique nonce for each form, place the nonce into the form, and verify the nonce upon receipt of the form. Be sure that the nonce is not predictable (CWE-330). [REF-332]<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Note that this can be bypassed using XSS (CWE-79).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Identify especially dangerous operations. When the user performs a dangerous operation, send a separate confirmation request to ensure that the user intended to perform that operation.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Note that this can be bypassed using XSS (CWE-79).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Use the \"double-submitted cookie\" method as described by Felten and Zeller:<br/><br/>When a user visits a site, the site should generate a pseudorandom value and set it as a cookie on the user's machine. The site should require every form submission to include this value as a form value and also as a cookie value. When a POST request is sent to the site, the request should only be considered valid if the form value and the cookie value are the same.<br/><br/>Because of the same-origin policy, an attacker cannot read or modify the value stored in the cookie. To successfully submit a form on behalf of the user, the attacker would have to correctly guess the pseudorandom value. If the pseudorandom value is cryptographically strong, this will be prohibitively difficult.<br/><br/>This technique requires Javascript, so it may not work for browsers that have Javascript disabled. [REF-331]<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Note that this can probably be bypassed using XSS (CWE-79), or when using web technologies that enable the attacker to read raw headers from HTTP requests.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Do not use the GET method for any request that triggers a state change.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Check the HTTP Referer header to see if the request originated from an expected page. This could break legitimate functionality, because users or proxies may have disabled sending the Referer for privacy reasons.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Note that this can be bypassed using XSS (CWE-79). An attacker could use XSS to generate a spoofed Referer, or to generate a malicious request from a page whose Referer would be allowed.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.<br/><br/>Specifically, manual analysis can be useful for finding this weakness, and for minimizing false positives assuming an understanding of business logic. However, it might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints. For black-box analysis, if credentials are not known for privileged accounts, then the most security-critical portions of the application may not receive sufficient attention.<br/><br/>Consider using OWASP CSRFTester to identify potential issues and aid in manual analysis.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/>Effectiveness Notes: These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: CSRF is currently difficult to detect reliably using automated techniques. This is because each application has its own implicit security policy that dictates which requests can be influenced by an outsider and automatically performed on behalf of a user, versus which requests require strong confidence that the user intends to make the request. For example, a keyword search of the public portion of a web site is typically expected to be encoded within a link that can be launched automatically when the user clicks on the link.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial"

For example, suppose a device contains the ability to dump the content of the full system memory by disabling the memory-protection mechanisms.

However, the risk is greater when the chip designer is employed by one company, the chip manufacturer is employed by another company (a foundry), and the assemblers and testers are employed by yet a third company. Since these different companies will need to perform various tests on the device to verify correct device function, they all need to share the unlock key.

All input should be neutralized, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including tag attributes, hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. We often encounter data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Output Encoding<br/>Description: Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.<br/><br/>The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: With Struts, write all data from form beans with the bean's filter attribute set to true.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.<br/>Effectiveness: Defense in Depth"

If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.<br/><br/>Specifically, manual static analysis is typically required to find the behavior that triggers the download of code, and to determine whether integrity-checking methods are in use.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Black Box<br/>Description: Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.<br/><br/>Attach the monitor to the process and also sniff the network connection. Trigger features related to product updates or plugin installation, which is likely to force a code download. Monitor when files are downloaded and separately executed, or if they are otherwise read back into the process. Look for evidence of cryptographic library calls that use integrity checking.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)<br/>Effectiveness: High"

Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Output Encoding<br/>Description: While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked."

Other pre-existing weaknesses can turn into security vulnerabilities if they occur while operating at raised privileges.<br/><br/>Privilege management functions can behave in some less-than-obvious ways, and they have different quirks on different platforms. These inconsistencies are particularly pronounced if you are transitioning from one non-root user to another. Signal handlers and spawned processes run at the privilege of the owning process, so if a process is running as root when a signal fires or a sub-process is executed, the signal handler or sub-process will operate with root privileges.",

That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Separation of Privilege<br/>Description: Identify the functionality that requires additional privileges, such as access to privileged operating system resources.

Raise privileges as late as possible, and drop them as soon as possible to avoid CWE-271.

Avoid weaknesses such as CWE-288 and CWE-420 by protecting all possible communication channels that could interact with the privileged code, such as a secondary socket that is only intended to be accessed by administrators.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Perform extensive input validation for any privileged code that must be exposed to the user and reject anything that does not fit your strict requirements.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: When dropping privileges, ensure that they have been dropped successfully to avoid CWE-273. As protection mechanisms in the environment get stronger, privilege-dropping calls may fail even if it seems like they would always succeed.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: If circumstances force you to run with extra privileges, then determine the minimum access level necessary. First identify the different permissions that the software and its users will need to perform their actions, such as file read and write permissions, network socket permissions, and so forth. Then explicitly allow those actions while denying all else [REF-76]. Perform extensive input validation and canonicalization to minimize the chances of introducing a separate vulnerability.

This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Black Box<br/>Description: Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.<br/><br/>Attach the monitor to the process and perform a login. Look for library functions and system calls that indicate when privileges are being raised or dropped. Look for accesses of resources that are restricted to normal users.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Note that this technique is only useful for privilege issues related to system resources. It is not likely to detect application-level business rules that are related to privileges, such as if a blog system allows a user to delete a blog entry without first checking that the user has administrator privileges.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High"

Use an appropriate combination of denylists and allowlists to ensure only valid, expected and appropriate input is processed by the system.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Output Encoding<br/>Description: While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked."

A possible result is that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory region but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory region.<br/><br/>Hardware product designs often need to implement memory protection features that enable privileged software to define isolated memory regions and access control (read/write) policies. Isolated memory regions can be defined on different memory spaces in a design (e.g. system physical address, virtual address, memory mapped IO).<br/><br/>Each memory cell should be mapped and assigned a system address that the core software can use to read/write to that memory. It is possible to map the same memory cell to multiple system addresses such that read/write to any of the aliased system addresses would be decoded to the same memory cell.<br/><br/>This is commonly done in hardware designs for redundancy and simplifying address decoding logic. If one of the memory regions is corrupted or faulty, then that hardware can switch to using the data in the mirrored memory region. Memory aliases can also be created in the system address map if the address decoder unit ignores higher order address bits when mapping a smaller address region into the full system address.<br/><br/>A common security weakness that can exist in such memory mapping is that aliased memory regions could have different read/write access protections enforced by the hardware such that an untrusted agent is blocked from accessing a memory address but is not blocked from accessing the corresponding aliased memory address. Such inconsistency can then be used to bypass the access protection of the primary memory block and read or modify the protected memory.<br/><br/>An untrusted agent could also possibly create memory aliases in the system address map for malicious purposes if it is able to change the mapping of an address region or modify memory region sizes.",

For example, a database may restrict access for medical records to a specific database user, but each record might only be intended to be accessible to the patient and the patient's doctor.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks<br/>Description: Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.<br/><br/>For example, consider using authorization frameworks such as the JAAS Authorization Framework [REF-233] and the OWASP ESAPI Access Control feature [REF-45].<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For web applications, make sure that the access control mechanism is enforced correctly at the server side on every page. Users should not be able to access any unauthorized functionality or information by simply requesting direct access to that page.<br/><br/>One way to do this is to ensure that all pages containing sensitive information are not cached, and that all such pages restrict access to requests that are accompanied by an active and authenticated session token associated with a user who has the required permissions to access that page.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: System Configuration, Installation<br/>Description: Use the access control capabilities of your operating system and server environment and define your access control lists accordingly. Use a \"default deny\" policy when defining these ACLs.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated static analysis is useful for detecting commonly-used idioms for authorization. A tool may be able to analyze related configuration files, such as .htaccess in Apache web servers, or detect the usage of commonly-used authorization libraries.<br/><br/>Generally, automated static analysis tools have difficulty detecting custom authorization schemes. In addition, the software's design may include some functionality that is accessible to any user and does not require an authorization check; an automated technique that detects the absence of authorization may report false positives.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Dynamic Analysis<br/>Description: Automated dynamic analysis may find many or all possible interfaces that do not require authorization, but manual analysis is required to determine if the lack of authorization violates business logic<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.<br/><br/>Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of custom authorization mechanisms.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules. However, manual efforts might not achieve desired code coverage within limited time constraints.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High"

The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.<br/><br/>If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.<br/><br/>Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.<br/><br/>Exposing additional information to a potential attacker in the context of an exceptional condition can help the attacker determine what attack vectors are most likely to succeed beyond DoS.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Performing extensive input validation does not help with handling unusual conditions, but it will minimize their occurrences and will make it more difficult for attackers to trigger them.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Implementation<br/>Description: If the program must fail, ensure that it fails gracefully (fails closed). There may be a temptation to simply let the program fail poorly in cases such as low memory conditions, but an attacker may be able to assert control before the software has fully exited. Alternately, an uncontrolled failure could cause cascading problems with other downstream components; for example, the program could send a signal to a downstream process so the process immediately knows that a problem has occurred and has a better chance of recovery.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Use system limits, which should help to prevent resource exhaustion. However, the product should still handle low resource conditions since they may still occur.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated static analysis may be useful for detecting unusual conditions involving system resources or common programming idioms, but not for violations of business rules.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Dynamic Analysis<br/>Description: Identify error conditions that are not likely to occur during normal usage and trigger them. For example, run the program under low memory conditions, run with insufficient privileges or permissions, interrupt a transaction before it is completed, or disable connectivity to basic network services such as DNS. Monitor the software for any unexpected behavior. If you trigger an unhandled exception or similar error that was discovered and handled by the application's environment, it may still indicate unexpected conditions that were not handled by the application itself."

Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-185] provide this capability.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When validating filenames, use stringent lists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.<br/><br/>This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.<br/><br/>Many file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Firewall<br/>Description: Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Develop and run your code in the most recent versions of PHP available, preferably PHP 6 or later. Many of the highly risky features in earlier PHP interpreters have been removed, restricted, or disabled by default.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.<br/><br/>Often, programmers do not protect direct access to files intended only to be included by core programs. These include files may assume that critical variables have already been initialized by the calling program. As a result, the use of register_globals combined with the ability to directly access the include file may allow attackers to conduct file inclusion attacks. This remains an extremely common pattern as of 2009.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Set allow_url_fopen to false, which limits the ability to include files from remote locations.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Be aware that some versions of PHP will still accept ftp:// and other URI schemes. In addition, this setting does not protect the code from path traversal attacks (CWE-22), which are frequently successful against the same vulnerable code that allows remote file inclusion.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: Manual white-box analysis can be very effective for finding this issue, since there is typically a relatively small number of include or require statements in each program.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: The external control or influence of filenames can often be detected using automated static analysis that models data flow within the product.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes. If the program uses a customized input validation library, then some tools may allow the analyst to create custom signatures to detect usage of those routines."

These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.<br/><br/>For example, stored procedures can enforce database query structure and reduce the likelihood of SQL injection.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Implementation<br/>Description: Understand the context in which your data will be used and the encoding that will be expected. This is especially important when transmitting data between different components, or when generating outputs that can contain multiple encodings at the same time, such as web pages or multi-part mail messages. Study all expected communication protocols and data representations to determine the required encoding strategies.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: In some cases, input validation may be an important strategy when output encoding is not a complete solution. For example, you may be providing the same output that will be processed by multiple consumers that use different encodings or representations. In other cases, you may be required to allow user-supplied input to contain control information, such as limited HTML tags that support formatting in a wiki or bulletin board. When this type of requirement must be met, use an extremely strict allowlist to limit which control sequences can be used. Verify that the resulting syntactic structure is what you expect. Use your normal encoding methods for the remainder of the input.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: Use input validation as a defense-in-depth measure to reduce the likelihood of output encoding errors (see CWE-20).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Requirements<br/>Description: Fully specify which encodings are required by components that will be communicating with each other.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Dynamic Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results."

As a result they may introduce a weakness by not            accounting for the modified behavior of critical components            when in extreme environments.<br/><br/>An example of a change in behavior is that power loss            won't clear/reset any volatile state when cooled below            standard operating temperatures. This may result in            a weakness when the starting state of the volatile memory is            being relied upon for a security decision. For example, a            Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) may be supplied as a            security primitive to improve confidentiality,            authenticity, and integrity guarantees. However, when the            PUF is paired with DRAM, SRAM, or another temperature            sensitive entropy source, the system designer may introduce            weakness by failing to account for the chosen entropy            source's behavior at exceptionally low temperatures. In the            case of DRAM and SRAM, when power is cycled at low            temperatures, the device will not contain the bitwise            biasing caused by inconsistencies in manufacturing and will            instead contain the data from previous boot. Should the PUF            primitive be used in a cryptographic construction which            does not account for full adversary control of PUF seed            data, weakness would arise.<br/><br/>This weakness does not cover \"Cold Boot Attacks\"            wherein RAM or other external storage is super cooled and            read externally by an attacker.",

        "description": "The product receives input or data, but it doesnot validate or incorrectly validates that the input has theproperties that are required to process the data safely andcorrectly.<br/><br/>Input validation is a frequently-used technique   for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to   ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the   code, or when communicating with other components.  When   software does not validate input properly, an attacker is   able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by   the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the   system receiving unintended input, which may result in   altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or   arbitrary code execution.<br/><br/>Input validation is not the only technique for   processing input, however.  Other techniques attempt to   transform potentially-dangerous input into something safe, such   as filtering (CWE-790) - which attempts to remove dangerous   inputs - or encoding/escaping (CWE-116), which attempts to   ensure that the input is not misinterpreted when it is included   in output to another component. Other techniques exist as well   (see CWE-138 for more examples.)<br/><br/>Input validation can be applied to:<br/><br/>Data can be simple or structured.  Structured data   can be composed of many nested layers, composed of   combinations of metadata and raw data, with other simple or   structured data.<br/><br/>Many properties of raw data or metadata may need   to be validated upon entry into the code, such   as:<br/><br/>Implied or derived properties of data must often   be calculated or inferred by the code itself.  Errors in   deriving properties may be considered a contributing factor   to improper input validation.<br/><br/>Note that \"input validation\" has very different   meanings to different people, or within different   classification schemes.  Caution must be used when   referencing this CWE entry or mapping to it.  For example,   some weaknesses might involve inadvertently giving control   to an attacker over an input when they should not be able   to provide an input at all, but sometimes this is referred   to as input validation.<br/><br/>Finally, it is important to emphasize that the   distinctions between input validation and output escaping   are often blurred, and developers must be careful to   understand the difference, including how input validation   is not always sufficient to prevent vulnerabilities,   especially when less stringent data types must be   supported, such as free-form text. Consider a SQL injection   scenario in which a person's last name is inserted into a   query. The name \"O'Reilly\" would likely pass the validation   step since it is a common last name in the English   language. However, this valid name cannot be directly   inserted into the database because it contains the \"'\"   apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or   otherwise transformed. In this case, removing the   apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it   would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name   would be recorded.",

This effectively requires parsing to be a distinct layer that effectively enforces a boundary between raw input and internal data representations, instead of allowing parser code to be scattered throughout the program, where it could be subject to errors or inconsistencies that create weaknesses. [REF-1109] [REF-1110] [REF-1111]<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks<br/>Description: Use an input validation framework such as Struts or the OWASP ESAPI Validation API. Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to server-side security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: When your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but violate the intended restrictions after they have been combined.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger an overflow.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the input's values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies are maintained.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control.<br/><br/>Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Some instances of improper input validation can be detected using automated static analysis.<br/><br/>A static analysis tool might allow the user to specify which application-specific methods or functions perform input validation; the tool might also have built-in knowledge of validation frameworks such as Struts. The tool may then suppress or de-prioritize any associated warnings. This allows the analyst to focus on areas of the software in which input validation does not appear to be present.<br/><br/>Except in the cases described in the previous paragraph, automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis<br/>Description: When custom input validation is required, such as when enforcing business rules, manual analysis is necessary to ensure that the validation is properly implemented.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Fuzzing<br/>Description: Fuzzing techniques can be useful for detecting input validation errors. When unexpected inputs are provided to the software, the software should not crash or otherwise become unstable, and it should generate application-controlled error messages. If exceptions or interpreter-generated error messages occur, this indicates that the input was not detected and handled within the application logic itself.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High"

        "remediation_recommendation": "Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.<br/><br/>Use a built-in path canonicalization function (such as realpath() in C) that produces the canonical version of the pathname, which effectively removes \"..\" sequences and symbolic links (CWE-23, CWE-59). This includes:<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks<br/>Description: Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Firewall<br/>Description: Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Enforcement by Conversion<br/>Description: When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.<br/><br/>For example, ID 1 could map to \"inbox.txt\" and ID 2 could map to \"profile.txt\". Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-185] provide this capability.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.<br/><br/>This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.<br/><br/>If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.<br/><br/>Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.<br/><br/>In the context of path traversal, error messages which disclose path information can help attackers craft the appropriate attack strings to move through the file system hierarchy.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated techniques can find areas where path traversal weaknesses exist.

Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Directly convert your input type into the expected data type, such as using a conversion function that translates a string into a number. After converting to the expected data type, ensure that the input's values fall within the expected range of allowable values and that multi-field consistencies are maintained.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180, CWE-181). Make sure that your application does not inadvertently decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked. Use libraries such as the OWASP ESAPI Canonicalization control.<br/><br/>Consider performing repeated canonicalization until your input does not change any more. This will avoid double-decoding and similar scenarios, but it might inadvertently modify inputs that are allowed to contain properly-encoded dangerous content.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: When exchanging data between components, ensure that both components are using the same character encoding. Ensure that the proper encoding is applied at each interface. Explicitly set the encoding you are using whenever the protocol allows you to do so.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: When your application combines data from multiple sources, perform the validation after the sources have been combined. The individual data elements may pass the validation step but violate the intended restrictions after they have been combined.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Testing<br/>Description: Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Testing<br/>Description: Use dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)<br/>Effectiveness: High",

As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.<br/><br/>Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon (\"<3\") would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the \"<\" character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the \"<\" might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities.<br/><br/>Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.<br/><br/>Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Enforcement by Conversion<br/>Description: When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Firewall<br/>Description: Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness. Many modern techniques use data flow analysis to minimize the number of false positives. This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible, especially when multiple components are involved.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/><br/>Detection Method: Black Box<br/>Description: Use the XSS Cheat Sheet [REF-714] or automated test-generation tools to help launch a wide variety of attacks against your web application. The Cheat Sheet contains many subtle XSS variations that are specifically targeted against weak XSS defenses.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: With Stored XSS, the indirection caused by the data store can make it more difficult to find the problem. The tester must first inject the XSS string into the data store, then find the appropriate application functionality in which the XSS string is sent to other users of the application. These are two distinct steps in which the activation of the XSS can take place minutes, hours, or days after the XSS was originally injected into the data store.",

Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.<br/><br/>The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used. This can open up the browser to subtle XSS attacks.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers.

All input should be neutralized, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. We often encounter data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Output Encoding<br/>Description: Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.<br/><br/>The problem of inconsistent output encodings often arises in web pages. If an encoding is not specified in an HTTP header, web browsers often guess about which encoding is being used.

This weakness can lead to a vulnerability in environments in which the attacker does not have direct access to the operating system, such as in web applications. Alternately, if the weakness occurs in a privileged program, it could allow the attacker to specify commands that normally would not be accessible, or to call alternate commands with privileges that the attacker does not have. The problem is exacerbated if the compromised process does not follow the principle of least privilege, because the attacker-controlled commands may run with special system privileges that increases the amount of damage.<br/><br/>There are at least two subtypes of OS command injection:<br/><br/>From a weakness standpoint, these variants represent distinct programmer errors. In the first variant, the programmer clearly intends that input from untrusted parties will be part of the arguments in the command to be executed. In the second variant, the programmer does not intend for the command to be accessible to any untrusted party, but the programmer probably has not accounted for alternate ways in which malicious attackers can provide input.",

This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: For any data that will be used to generate a command to be executed, keep as much of that data out of external control as possible. For example, in web applications, this may require storing the data locally in the session's state instead of sending it out to the client in a hidden form field.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Libraries or Frameworks<br/>Description: Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.<br/><br/>For example, consider using the ESAPI Encoding control [REF-45] or a similar tool, library, or framework. These will help the programmer encode outputs in a manner less prone to error.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Output Encoding<br/>Description: While it is risky to use dynamically-generated query strings, code, or commands that mix control and data together, sometimes it may be unavoidable. Properly quote arguments and escape any special characters within those arguments. The most conservative approach is to escape or filter all characters that do not pass an extremely strict allowlist (such as everything that is not alphanumeric or white space). If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: If the program to be executed allows arguments to be specified within an input file or from standard input, then consider using that mode to pass arguments instead of the command line.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Parameterization<br/>Description: If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code. These mechanisms may be able to provide the relevant quoting, encoding, and validation automatically, instead of relying on the developer to provide this capability at every point where output is generated.<br/><br/>Some languages offer multiple functions that can be used to invoke commands. Where possible, identify any function that invokes a command shell using a single string, and replace it with a function that requires individual arguments. These functions typically perform appropriate quoting and filtering of arguments. For example, in C, the system() function accepts a string that contains the entire command to be executed, whereas execl(), execve(), and others require an array of strings, one for each argument. In Windows, CreateProcess() only accepts one command at a time. In Perl, if system() is provided with an array of arguments, then it will quote each of the arguments.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When constructing OS command strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping.<br/><br/>Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing OS command injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent OS command injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, when invoking a mail program, you might need to allow the subject field to contain otherwise-dangerous inputs like \";\" and \">\" characters, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the character might reduce the risk of OS command injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the subject field would not be recorded as the user intended. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it could be more important when the program relies on well-structured subject lines in order to pass messages to other components.<br/><br/>Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Enforcement by Conversion<br/>Description: When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Compilation or Build Hardening<br/>Description: Run the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's \"-T\" switch. This will force the program to perform validation steps that remove the taint, although you must be careful to correctly validate your inputs so that you do not accidentally mark dangerous inputs as untainted (see CWE-183 and CWE-184).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run the code in an environment that performs automatic taint propagation and prevents any command execution that uses tainted variables, such as Perl's \"-T\" switch. This will force the program to perform validation steps that remove the taint, although you must be careful to correctly validate your inputs so that you do not accidentally mark dangerous inputs as untainted (see CWE-183 and CWE-184).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else. The messages need to strike the balance between being too cryptic (which can confuse users) or being too detailed (which may reveal more than intended). The messages should not reveal the methods that were used to determine the error. Attackers can use detailed information to refine or optimize their original attack, thereby increasing their chances of success.<br/><br/>If errors must be captured in some detail, record them in log messages, but consider what could occur if the log messages can be viewed by attackers. Highly sensitive information such as passwords should never be saved to log files.<br/><br/>Avoid inconsistent messaging that might accidentally tip off an attacker about internal state, such as whether a user account exists or not.<br/><br/>In the context of OS Command Injection, error information passed back to the user might reveal whether an OS command is being executed and possibly which command is being used.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Use runtime policy enforcement to create an allowlist of allowable commands, then prevent use of any command that does not appear in the allowlist. Technologies such as AppArmor are available to do this.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Firewall<br/>Description: Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: When using PHP, configure the application so that it does not use register_globals. During implementation, develop the application so that it does not rely on this feature, but be wary of implementing a register_globals emulation that is subject to weaknesses such as CWE-95, CWE-621, and similar issues.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis might not be able to recognize when proper input validation is being performed, leading to false positives - i.e., warnings that do not have any security consequences or require any code changes.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis might not be able to detect the usage of custom API functions or third-party libraries that indirectly invoke OS commands, leading to false negatives - especially if the API/library code is not available for analysis.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Dynamic Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the product using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The product's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis<br/>Description: Since this weakness does not typically appear frequently within a single software package, manual white box techniques may be able to provide sufficient code coverage and reduction of false positives if all potentially-vulnerable operations can be assessed within limited time constraints.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High",

Working at the SoC or platform base, level sensors may be implemented to detect glitches. Implementing redundancy in security-sensitive code (e.g., where checks are performed)also can help with mitigation of glitch attacks.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: Put the processor in an infiniteloop, which is then followed by instructionsthat should not ever be executed, since theloop is not expected to exit.  After the loop,toggle an I/O bit (for oscilloscope monitoringpurposes), print a console message, andreenter the loop.  Note that to ensure thatthe loop exit is actually captured, many NOPinstructions should be coded after the loopbranch instruction and before the I/O bittoggle and the print statement.<br/><br/>Margining the clock consists of varying the clockfrequency until an anomaly occurs. This could be acontinuous frequency change or it could be a singlecycle. The single cycle method is described here. Forevery 1000th clock pulse, the clock cycle is shortened by10 percent. If no effect is observed, the width isshortened by 20%. This process is continued in 10%increments up to and including 50%. Note that the cycletime may be increased as well, down to seconds percycle.<br/><br/>Separately, the voltage is margined. Note thatthe voltage could be increased or decreased. Increasingthe voltage has limits, as the circuitry may not be ableto withstand a drastically increased voltage. This processstarts with a 5% reduction of the DC supply to the CPUchip for 5 millisecond repeated at 1KHz. If this has noeffect, the process is repeated, but a 10% reduction isused.

If no effects are observed, the processis repeated in 10 millisecond increments out to 100millisecond pulses.<br/><br/>While these are suggested starting points fortesting circuitry for weaknesses, the limits may need tobe pushed further at the risk of device damage.

For example, suppose a critical authentication routine that an attacker would want to bypass is given the protection of modifying certain artifacts from within that specific routine (so that if the routine is bypassed, one can examine the artifacts and figure out that an attack must have happened). However, if the attacker has the ability to bypass the critical authentication routine, they might also have the ability to bypass the other protection routine that checks the artifacts. Basically, depending on these kind of protections is akin to resorting to \"Security by Obscurity\".<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: Many SoCs come equipped with a built-in Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) that can control the voltage and clocks via software alone. However, there have been demonstrated attacks (like Plundervolt and CLKSCREW) that target this DVFS [REF-1081] [REF-1082]. During the design and implementation phases, one needs to check if the interface to this power management feature is available from unprivileged SW (CWE-1256), which would make the attack very easy."

        "remediation_recommendation": "Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Output Encoding<br/>Description: Use and specify an output encoding that can be handled by the downstream component that is reading the output. Common encodings include ISO-8859-1, UTF-7, and UTF-8. When an encoding is not specified, a downstream component may choose a different encoding, either by assuming a default encoding or automatically inferring which encoding is being used, which can be erroneous. When the encodings are inconsistent, the downstream component might treat some character or byte sequences as special, even if they are not special in the original encoding. Attackers might then be able to exploit this discrepancy and conduct injection attacks; they even might be able to bypass protection mechanisms that assume the original encoding is also being used by the downstream component.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180).

        "remediation_recommendation": "Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Use an input validation framework such as Struts or the OWASP ESAPI Validation API. Note that using a framework does not automatically address all input validation problems; be mindful of weaknesses that could arise from misusing the framework itself (CWE-1173).<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Even though client-side checks provide minimal benefits with respect to server-side security, they are still useful. First, they can support intrusion detection. If the server receives input that should have been rejected by the client, then it may be an indication of an attack. Second, client-side error-checking can provide helpful feedback to the user about the expectations for valid input. Third, there may be a reduction in server-side processing time for accidental input errors, although this is typically a small savings.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Requirements<br/>Strategy: Language Selection<br/>Description: Use a language that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.<br/><br/>For example, Ada allows the programmer to constrain the values of a variable and languages such as Java and Ruby will allow the programmer to handle exceptions when an out-of-bounds index is accessed.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation, Build and Compilation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run or compile the software using features or extensions that randomly arrange the positions of a program's executable and libraries in memory. Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.<br/><br/>Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing\" (for Windows) and \"prelinking\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.<br/><br/>For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].<br/>Effectiveness: Defense in Depth<br/>Effectiveness Notes: These techniques do not provide a complete solution.  For instance, exploits frequently use a bug that discloses memory addresses in order to maximize reliability of code execution [REF-1337]. It has also been shown that a side-channel attack can bypass ASLR [REF-1333]<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Use a CPU and operating system that offers Data Execution Protection (using hardware NX or XD bits) or the equivalent techniques that simulate this feature in software, such as PaX [REF-60] [REF-61]. These techniques ensure that any instruction executed is exclusively at a memory address that is part of the code segment.<br/><br/>For more information on these techniques see D3-PSEP (Process Segment Execution Prevention) from D3FEND [REF-1336].<br/>Effectiveness: Defense in Depth<br/>Effectiveness Notes: This is not a complete solution, since buffer overflows could be used to overwrite nearby variables to modify the software's state in dangerous ways. In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When accessing a user-controlled array index, use a stringent range of values that are within the target array. Make sure that you do not allow negative values to be used. That is, verify the minimum as well as the maximum of the range of acceptable values.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Be especially careful to validate all input when invoking code that crosses language boundaries, such as from an interpreted language to native code. This could create an unexpected interaction between the language boundaries. Ensure that you are not violating any of the expectations of the language with which you are interfacing. For example, even though Java may not be susceptible to buffer overflows, providing a large argument in a call to native code might trigger an overflow.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting out-of-bounds memory operations. This can make it difficult for users to determine which warnings should be investigated first. For example, an analysis tool might report array index errors that originate from command line arguments in a program that is not expected to run with setuid or other special privileges.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/>Effectiveness Notes: This is not a perfect solution, since 100% accuracy and coverage are not feasible.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Dynamic Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using dynamic tools and techniques that interact with the software using large test suites with many diverse inputs, such as fuzz testing (fuzzing), robustness testing, and fault injection. The software's operation may slow down, but it should not become unstable, crash, or generate incorrect results.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Black Box<br/>Description: Black box methods might not get the needed code coverage within limited time constraints, and a dynamic test might not produce any noticeable side effects even if it is successful."

When a different entity obtains access to the IP due to a change in operating mode or conditions, the new entity can extract information belonging to the previous user if no mechanisms are in place to clear register contents. It is important to clear information stored in the hardware if a physical attack on the product is detected, or if the user of the hardware block changes.

Features such as the ESAPI AccessReferenceMap [REF-45] provide this capability.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: Store library, include, and utility files outside of the web document root, if possible. Otherwise, store them in a separate directory and use the web server's access control capabilities to prevent attackers from directly requesting them. One common practice is to define a fixed constant in each calling program, then check for the existence of the constant in the library/include file; if the constant does not exist, then the file was directly requested, and it can exit immediately.<br/><br/>This significantly reduces the chance of an attacker being able to bypass any protection mechanisms that are in the base program but not in the include files. It will also reduce the attack surface.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Implementation<br/>Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction<br/>Description: Understand all the potential areas where untrusted inputs can enter your software: parameters or arguments, cookies, anything read from the network, environment variables, reverse DNS lookups, query results, request headers, URL components, e-mail, files, filenames, databases, and any external systems that provide data to the application. Remember that such inputs may be obtained indirectly through API calls.<br/><br/>Many file inclusion problems occur because the programmer assumed that certain inputs could not be modified, especially for cookies and URL components.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Operation<br/>Strategy: Firewall<br/>Description: Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness. It can be beneficial in cases in which the code cannot be fixed (because it is controlled by a third party), as an emergency prevention measure while more comprehensive software assurance measures are applied, or to provide defense in depth.<br/>Effectiveness: Moderate<br/>Effectiveness Notes: An application firewall might not cover all possible input vectors. In addition, attack techniques might be available to bypass the protection mechanism, such as using malformed inputs that can still be processed by the component that receives those inputs. Depending on functionality, an application firewall might inadvertently reject or modify legitimate requests. Finally, some manual effort may be required for customization.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High"

Because this makes the addresses unpredictable, it can prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to exploitable code.<br/><br/>Examples include Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) [REF-58] [REF-60] and Position-Independent Executables (PIE) [REF-64]. Imported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing\" (for Windows) and \"prelinking\" (for Linux) [REF-1332] using randomly generated addresses. ASLR for libraries cannot be used in conjunction with prelink since it would require relocating the libraries at run-time, defeating the whole purpose of prelinking.<br/><br/>For more information on these techniques see D3-SAOR (Segment Address Offset Randomization) from D3FEND [REF-1335].<br/>Effectiveness: Defense in Depth<br/>Effectiveness Notes: These techniques do not provide a complete solution.

In addition, it cannot be used in cases in which self-modifying code is required. Finally, an attack could still cause a denial of service, since the typical response is to exit the application.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Compilation or Build Hardening<br/>Description: Examine compiler warnings closely and eliminate problems with potential security implications, such as signed / unsigned mismatch in memory operations, or use of uninitialized variables. Even if the weakness is rarely exploitable, a single failure may lead to the compromise of the entire system.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Environment Hardening<br/>Description: Run your code using the lowest privileges that are required to accomplish the necessary tasks [REF-76]. If possible, create isolated accounts with limited privileges that are only used for a single task. That way, a successful attack will not immediately give the attacker access to the rest of the software or its environment. For example, database applications rarely need to run as the database administrator, especially in day-to-day operations.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design, Operation<br/>Strategy: Sandbox or Jail<br/>Description: Run the code in a \"jail\" or similar sandbox environment that enforces strict boundaries between the process and the operating system. This may effectively restrict which files can be accessed in a particular directory or which commands can be executed by the software.<br/><br/>OS-level examples include the Unix chroot jail, AppArmor, and SELinux. In general, managed code may provide some protection. For example, java.io.FilePermission in the Java SecurityManager allows the software to specify restrictions on file operations.<br/><br/>This may not be a feasible solution, and it only limits the impact to the operating system; the rest of the application may still be subject to compromise.<br/><br/>Be careful to avoid CWE-243 and other weaknesses related to jails.<br/>Effectiveness: Limited<br/>Effectiveness Notes: The effectiveness of this mitigation depends on the prevention capabilities of the specific sandbox or jail being used and might only help to reduce the scope of an attack, such as restricting the attacker to certain system calls or limiting the portion of the file system that can be accessed.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can often be detected using automated static analysis tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.<br/><br/>Automated static analysis generally does not account for environmental considerations when reporting potential errors in buffer calculations.

This becomes difficult for weaknesses that must be considered for all inputs, since the attack surface can be too large.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.<br/><br/>Specifically, manual static analysis is useful for evaluating the correctness of allocation calculations.

        "description": "The product parses numeric input assuming base 10 (decimal) values, but it does not account for inputs that use a different base number (radix).<br/><br/>Frequently, a numeric input that begins with \"0\" is treated as octal, or \"0x\" causes it to be treated as hexadecimal, e.g. by the inet_addr() function. For example, \"023\" (octal) is 35 decimal, or \"0x31\" is 49 decimal. Other bases may be used as well. If the developer assumes decimal-only inputs, the code could produce incorrect numbers when the inputs are parsed using a different base. This can result in unexpected and/or dangerous behavior. For example, a \"0127.0.0.1\" IP address is parsed as octal due to the leading \"0\", whose numeric value would be the same as 87.0.0.1 (decimal), where the developer likely expected to use 127.0.0.1.<br/><br/>The consequences vary depending on the surrounding code in which this weakness occurs, but they can include bypassing network-based access control using unexpected IP addresses or netmasks, or causing apparently-symbolic identifiers to be processed as if they are numbers. In web applications, this can enable bypassing of SSRF restrictions.",

Then the human analyst could evaluate permission assignments in the context of the intended security model of the software.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Fuzzing<br/>Description: Fuzzing is not effective in detecting this weakness.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Black Box<br/>Description: Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.<br/><br/>Attach the monitor to the process and watch for library functions or system calls on OS resources such as files, directories, and shared memory. Examine the arguments to these calls to infer which permissions are being used.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: Note that this technique is only useful for permissions issues related to system resources. It is not likely to detect application-level business rules that are related to permissions, such as if a user of a blog system marks a post as \"private,\" but the blog system inadvertently marks it as \"public.\"<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Binary or Bytecode<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Automated Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Dynamic Analysis with Manual Results Interpretation<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis - Source Code<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: SOAR Partial<br/><br/>Detection Method: Architecture or Design Review<br/>Description: According to SOAR, the following detection techniques may be useful:<br/>Effectiveness: High"

While the output is, in many cases,   sufficient for cryptographic uses, the output of any   PRNG is directly determined by the seed provided as   input. If the seed can be ascertained by a third party,   the entire output of the PRNG can be made known to   them. As such, the seed should be kept secret and   should ideally not be able to be guessed. For example,   the current time may be a poor seed.

However, implemented access controls lack required granularity, which renders the control policy too broad because it allows accesses from unauthorized agents to the security-sensitive assets.<br/><br/>Integrated circuits and hardware engines can expose accesses to assets (device configuration, keys, etc.) to trusted firmware or a software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader). This access is typically access-controlled. Upon a power reset, the hardware or system usually starts with default values in registers, and the trusted firmware (Boot firmware) configures the necessary access-control protection.<br/><br/>A common weakness that can exist in such protection schemes is that access controls or policies are not granular enough. This condition allows agents beyond trusted agents to access assets and could lead to a loss of functionality or the ability to set up the device securely. This further results in security risks from leaked, sensitive, key material to modification of device configuration.",

        "remediation_recommendation": "Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Use a browser that displays Punycode for IDNs in the URL and status bars, or which color code various scripts in URLs.<br/><br/>Due to the prominence of homoglyph attacks, several browsers now help safeguard against this attack via the use of Punycode. For example, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome will display IDNs as Punycode if top-level domains do not restrict which characters can be used in domain names or if labels mix scripts for different languages.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Description: Use an email client that has strict filters and prevents messages that mix character sets to end up in a user's inbox.<br/><br/>Certain email clients such as Google's GMail prevent the use of non-Latin characters in email addresses or in links contained within emails.

A cache memory is a common example of this concept, which keeps a \"local\" copy of a data element in the high speed cache memory. Unfortunately, this speed improvement comes with a downside, since the product needs to ensure that the local copy always mirrors the original copy truthfully. If they get out of sync, the computational result is no longer true.<br/><br/>During hardware design, memory is not the only item which gets mirrored. There are many other entities that get mirrored, as well: registers, memory regions, and, in some cases, even whole computational units.

In such cases, duplicating local MMUs that will serve only a subset of the cores rather than all of them may resolve the performance issue.

However, if all paths to            the asset are not protected, an attacker might compromise            the asset through alternate paths. These alternate paths            could be through shadow or mirror registers inside the IP            core, or could be paths from other external-facing            interfaces to the IP core or SoC.<br/><br/>Consider an SoC with various interfaces such as UART,            SMBUS, PCIe, USB, etc. If access control is implemented for            SoC internal registers only over the PCIe interface, then            an attacker could still modify the SoC internal registers            through alternate paths by coming through interfaces such            as UART, SMBUS, USB, etc.<br/><br/>Alternatively, attackers might be able to bypass            existing protections by exploiting unprotected, shadow            registers.

They are typically implemented within an            IP core or SoC to temporarily hold certain data. These data            will later be updated to the main register, and both            registers will be in synch.

For example, when managing system resources in POSIX, setrlimit() can be used to set limits for certain types of resources, and getrlimit() can determine how many resources are available. However, these functions are not available on all operating systems.<br/><br/>When the current levels get close to the maximum that is defined for the application (see CWE-770), then limit the allocation of further resources to privileged users; alternately, begin releasing resources for less-privileged users.

The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present.<br/><br/>If authorization, authentication, or some other form of access control is not implemented or not implemented correctly, a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through the debug interface.<br/><br/>Sometimes, designers choose not to expose the debug pins on the motherboard. Instead, they choose to hide these pins in the intermediate layers of the board. This is primarily done to work around the lack of debug authorization inside the chip. In such a scenario (without debug authorization), when the debug interface is exposed, chip internals are accessible to an attacker.",

Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.<br/><br/>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>When validating filenames, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set to be used. If feasible, only allow a single \".\" character in the filename to avoid weaknesses such as CWE-23, and exclude directory separators such as \"/\" to avoid CWE-36. Use a list of allowable file extensions, which will help to avoid CWE-434.<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on a filtering mechanism that removes potentially dangerous characters. This is equivalent to a denylist, which may be incomplete (CWE-184). For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182). For example, if \"../\" sequences are removed from the \".../...//\" string in a sequential fashion, two instances of \"../\" would be removed from the original string, but the remaining characters would still form the \"../\" string.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Implementation<br/>Strategy: Input Validation<br/>Description: Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked."

For example, suppose the product generates random numbers between 1 and 100, but it always produces a larger value until it reaches 100. If the generator produces an 80, then the attacker knows that the next value will be somewhere between 81 and 100. Instead of 100 possibilities, the attacker only needs to consider 20.",

These register contents have to be initialized at hardware reset to defined default values that are hard coded in the hardware description language (HDL) code of the hardware unit. A common security protection method used to protect register settings from modification by software is to make them write-once. This means the hardware implementation only allows writing to such registers once, and they become read-only after having been written once by software. This is useful to allow initial boot software to configure systems settings to secure values while blocking runtime software from modifying such hardware settings.<br/><br/>Implementation issues in hardware design of such controls can expose such registers to a race condition security flaw. For example, consider a hardware design that has two different software/firmware modules executing in parallel. One module is trusted (module A) and another is untrusted (module B). In this design it could be possible for Module B to send write cycles to the write-once register before Module A. Since the field is write-once the programmed value from Module A will be ignored and the pre-empted value programmed by Module B will be used by hardware.",

Often, however, such protocols employ the same pre-shared key for communication with a number of different entities. A malicious user or an attacker can easily compromise this protocol without possessing the correct key by employing a reflection attack on the protocol.<br/><br/>Reflection attacks capitalize on mutual authentication schemes in order to trick the target into revealing the secret shared between it and another valid user. In a basic mutual-authentication scheme, a secret is known to both the valid user and the server; this allows them to authenticate. In order that they may verify this shared secret without sending it plainly over the wire, they utilize a Diffie-Hellman-style scheme in which they each pick a value, then request the hash of that value as keyed by the shared secret. In a reflection attack, the attacker claims to be a valid user and requests the hash of a random value from the server. When the server returns this value and requests its own value to be hashed, the attacker opens another connection to the server. This time, the hash requested by the attacker is the value which the server requested in the first connection. When the server returns this hashed value, it is used in the first connection, authenticating the attacker successfully as the impersonated valid user.",

For example, filtering \"/\" is insufficient protection if the filesystem also supports the use of \"\\\" as a directory separator. Another possible error could occur when the filtering is applied in a way that still produces dangerous data (CWE-182).

As a result, the inability to patch or update can leave the product open to attacker exploitation or critical operation failures. This weakness can be especially difficult to manage when using ROM, firmware, or similar components that traditionally have had limited or no update capabilities.<br/><br/>In industries such as healthcare, \"legacy\"    devices can be operated for decades.

The most prominent is the stored return address, the memory address at which execution should continue once the current function is finished executing. The attacker can overwrite this value with some memory address to which the attacker also has write access, into which they place arbitrary code to be run with the full privileges of the vulnerable program. Alternately, the attacker can supply the address of an important call, for instance the POSIX system() call, leaving arguments to the call on the stack. This is often called a return into libc exploit, since the attacker generally forces the program to jump at return time into an interesting routine in the C standard library (libc). Other important data commonly on the stack include the stack pointer and frame pointer, two values that indicate offsets for computing memory addresses.

Furthermore, the HTTP specification requires that GET requests (and other requests) should not have side effects. Believing that it will be enough to prevent unintended resource alterations, an application may disallow the HTTP requests to perform DELETE, PUT and POST operations on the resource representation. However, there is nothing in the HTTP protocol itself that actually prevents the HTTP GET method from performing more than just query of the data. Developers can easily code programs that accept a HTTP GET request that do in fact create, update or delete data on the server. For instance, it is a common practice with REST based Web Services to have HTTP GET requests modifying resources on the server side.

        "description": "The product uses a fixed or controlled search path to find resources, but one or more locations in that path can be under the control of unintended actors.<br/><br/>Although this weakness can occur with any type of resource, it is frequently introduced when a product uses a directory search path to find executables or code libraries, but the path contains a directory that can be modified by an attacker, such as \"/tmp\" or the current working directory.<br/><br/>In Windows-based systems, when the LoadLibrary or LoadLibraryEx function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled:<br/><br/>In some cases, the attack can be conducted remotely, such as when SMB or WebDAV network shares are used.<br/><br/>One or more locations in that path could include the Windows drive root or its subdirectories. This often exists in Linux-based code assuming the controlled nature of the root directory (/) or its subdirectories (/etc, etc), or a code that recursively accesses the parent directory.  In Windows, the drive root and some of its subdirectories have weak permissions by default, which makes them uncontrolled.<br/><br/>In some Unix-based systems, a PATH might be created that contains an empty element, e.g. by splicing an empty variable into the PATH. This empty element can be interpreted as equivalent to the current working directory, which might be an untrusted search element.<br/><br/>In software package management frameworks (e.g., npm, RubyGems, or PyPi), the framework may identify dependencies on third-party libraries or other packages, then consult a repository that contains the desired package. The framework may search a public repository before a private repository. This could be exploited by attackers by placing a malicious package in the public repository that has the same name as a package from the private repository. The search path might not be directly under control of the developer relying on the framework, but this search order effectively contains an untrusted element.",

For example, system() in C does not require a full path since the shell can take care of it, while execl() and execv() require a full path.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Black Box<br/>Description: Use monitoring tools that examine the software's process as it interacts with the operating system and the network. This technique is useful in cases when source code is unavailable, if the software was not developed by you, or if you want to verify that the build phase did not introduce any new weaknesses. Examples include debuggers that directly attach to the running process; system-call tracing utilities such as truss (Solaris) and strace (Linux); system activity monitors such as FileMon, RegMon, Process Monitor, and other Sysinternals utilities (Windows); and sniffers and protocol analyzers that monitor network traffic.<br/><br/>Attach the monitor to the process and look for library functions and system calls that suggest when a search path is being used. One pattern is when the program performs multiple accesses of the same file but in different directories, with repeated failures until the proper filename is found. Library calls such as getenv() or their equivalent can be checked to see if any path-related variables are being accessed.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it. Typically, this is done by building a model of data flow and control flow, then searching for potentially-vulnerable patterns that connect \"sources\" (origins of input) with \"sinks\" (destinations where the data interacts with external components, a lower layer such as the OS, etc.)<br/>Effectiveness: High<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules."

        "description": "To fulfill the need for a cryptographic primitive, the product implements a cryptographic algorithm using a non-standard, unproven, or disallowed/non-compliant cryptographic implementation.<br/><br/>Cryptographic protocols and systems depend on cryptographic primitives (and associated algorithms) as their basic building blocks. Some common examples of primitives are digital signatures, one-way hash functions, ciphers, and public key cryptography; however, the notion of \"primitive\" can vary depending on point of view. See \"Terminology Notes\" for further explanation of some concepts.<br/><br/>Cryptographic primitives are defined to accomplish one very specific task in a precisely defined and mathematically reliable fashion. For example, suppose that for a specific cryptographic primitive (such as an encryption routine), the consensus is that the primitive can only be broken after trying out N different inputs (where the larger the value of N, the stronger the cryptography). For an encryption scheme like AES-256, one would expect N to be so large as to be infeasible to execute in a reasonable amount of time.<br/><br/>If a vulnerability is ever found that shows that one can break a cryptographic primitive in significantly less than the expected number of attempts, then that primitive is considered weakened (or sometimes in extreme cases, colloquially it is \"broken\"). As a result, anything using this cryptographic primitive would now be considered insecure or risky. Thus, even breaking or weakening a seemingly small cryptographic primitive has the potential to render the whole system vulnerable, due to its reliance on the primitive. A historical example can be found in TLS when using DES. One would colloquially call DES the cryptographic primitive for transport encryption in this version of TLS. In the past, DES was considered strong, because no weaknesses were found in it; importantly, DES has a key length of 56 bits. Trying N=2^56 keys was considered impractical for most actors. Unfortunately, attacking a system with 56-bit keys is now practical via brute force, which makes defeating DES encryption practical. It is now practical for an adversary to read any information sent under this version of TLS and use this information to attack the system. As a result, it can be claimed that this use of TLS is weak, and that any system depending on TLS with DES could potentially render the entire system vulnerable to attack.<br/><br/>Cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are only considered safe after extensive research and review from experienced cryptographers from academia, industry, and government entities looking for any possible flaws. Furthermore, cryptographic primitives and associated algorithms are frequently reevaluated for safety when new mathematical and attack techniques are discovered.  As a result and over time, even well-known cryptographic primitives can lose their compliance status with the discovery of novel attacks that might either defeat the algorithm or reduce its robustness significantly.<br/><br/>If ad-hoc cryptographic primitives are implemented, it is almost certain that the implementation will be vulnerable to attacks that are well understood by cryptographers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information and other consequences.<br/><br/>This weakness is even more difficult to manage for hardware-implemented deployment of cryptographic algorithms. First, because hardware is not patchable as easily as software, any flaw discovered after release and production typically cannot be fixed without a recall of the product. Secondly, the hardware product is often expected to work for years, during which time computation power available to the attacker only increases. Therefore, for hardware implementations of cryptographic primitives, it is absolutely essential that only strong, proven cryptographic primitives are used.",

For example, a feature might only be enabled through the system console instead of through a network connection.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For inbound authentication: apply strong one-way hashes to your passwords and store those hashes in a configuration file or database with appropriate access control. That way, theft of the file/database still requires the attacker to try to crack the password. When receiving an incoming password during authentication, take the hash of the password and compare it to the hash that you have saved.<br/><br/>Use randomly assigned salts for each separate hash that you generate. This increases the amount of computation that an attacker needs to conduct a brute-force attack, possibly limiting the effectiveness of the rainbow table method.<br/><br/>Mitigation Phase: Architecture and Design<br/>Description: For front-end to back-end connections: Three solutions are possible, although none are complete.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Manual Analysis<br/>Description: This weakness can be detected using tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session.<br/>Effectiveness Notes: These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques.

There are two variations on the standard broadcast intent, ordered and sticky.<br/><br/>Ordered broadcast intents are delivered to a series of registered receivers in order of priority as declared by the Receivers. A malicious receiver can give itself a high priority and cause a denial of service by stopping the broadcast from propagating further down the chain. There is also the possibility of malicious data modification, as a receiver may also alter the data within the Intent before passing it on to the next receiver. The downstream components have no way of asserting that the data has not been altered earlier in the chain.<br/><br/>Sticky broadcast intents remain accessible after the initial broadcast. An old sticky intent will be broadcast again to any new receivers that register for it in the future, greatly increasing the chances of information exposure over time. Also, sticky broadcasts cannot be protected by permissions that may apply to other kinds of intents.<br/><br/>In addition, any broadcast intent may include a URI that references data that the receiving component does not normally have the privileges to access.

In this design, authentication involves accepting an incoming password, computing its hash, and comparing it to the stored hash.<br/><br/>Many hash algorithms are designed to execute quickly with minimal overhead, even cryptographic hashes. However, this efficiency is a problem for password storage, because it can reduce an attacker's workload for brute-force password cracking. If an attacker can obtain the hashes through some other method (such as SQL injection on a database that stores hashes), then the attacker can store the hashes offline and use various techniques to crack the passwords by computing hashes efficiently. Without a built-in workload, modern attacks can compute large numbers of hashes, or even exhaust the entire space of all possible passwords, within a very short amount of time, using massively-parallel computing (such as cloud computing) and GPU, ASIC, or FPGA hardware. In such a scenario, an efficient hash algorithm helps the attacker.<br/><br/>There are several properties of a hash scheme that are relevant to its strength against an offline, massively-parallel attack:<br/><br/>Note that the security requirements for the product may vary depending on the environment and the value of the passwords. Different schemes might not provide all of these properties, yet may still provide sufficient security for the environment.

Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.<br/><br/>Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293]. While there is active debate about which of these is the most effective, they are all stronger than using salts with hash functions with very little computing overhead.<br/><br/>Note that using these functions can have an impact on performance, so they require special consideration to avoid denial-of-service attacks.

Note that some attacks might be more efficient than brute force but are still not regarded as achievable in the real world.<br/><br/>Any algorithm does not meet the above conditions will generally be considered weak for general use in hashing.<br/><br/>In addition to algorithmic weaknesses, a hash function can be made weak by using the hash in a security context that breaks its security guarantees. For example, using a hash function without a salt for storing passwords (that are sufficiently short) could enable an adversary to create a \"rainbow table\" [REF-637] to recover the password under certain conditions; this attack works against such hash functions as MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2.",

Some hash functions perform salting automatically. These functions can significantly increase the overhead for a brute force attack compared to intentionally-fast functions such as MD5. For example, rainbow table attacks can become infeasible due to the high computing overhead. Finally, since computing power gets faster and cheaper over time, the technique can be reconfigured to increase the workload without forcing an entire replacement of the algorithm in use.<br/><br/>Some hash functions that have one or more of these desired properties include bcrypt [REF-291], scrypt [REF-292], and PBKDF2 [REF-293].

As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<br/><br/>Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs.  This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<br/><br/>Detection Method: Automated Static Analysis<br/>Description: Automated static analysis, commonly referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), can find some instances of this weakness by analyzing source code (or binary/compiled code) without having to execute it.
