# Writeups
AttackForge provides you with vulnerability knowledgebases which you can import into your Writeups libraries to make your security reporting faster and easier.

A Writeup is a definition of a vulnerability, which at a minimum consists of:
- Title
- Description
- Remediation Recommendation

Writeups can have many more fields, including custom fields.
Writeups can also be assigned to libraries, along with access controls, to make managing your writeups easier.
